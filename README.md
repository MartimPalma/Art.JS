In this exercise you will recreate works of art by great painters. The initial three parts of the exercise focus on the work “The Starry Night”, by Van Gogh, while the fourth part is dedicated to the work of Piet Mondrian, both of which are incomplete. 
The goal is: part 1 – randomly add one of the four stars whenever the user clicks on the screen; 
part 2 – every 1000ms, add these stars, in a random position on the screen; 
part 3 – every 1000ms, add the stars, at the current mouse position; part 4 – the user must define the number of vertical and horizontal lines that will be randomly positioned in the work.
